E-commerce Store:
Build an e-commerce store with product listings, shopping cart functionality, and order management.
The model complexity can include defining relationships between products, categories, and user
orders. The view logic can involve handling product searches, adding items to the cart, and
processing orders. The template complexity can be reduced by using CSS frameworks like Tailwind
to style the store.
